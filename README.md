# AMCMS
The AMCMS repository contains the components, object classes, modules and other code relating to the AMCMS.

AMCMS was started back in 2007 and has become a really big project. I work on it alone so it came together slowly.

In 2013 I was diagnosed with cancer and AMCMS was put on hold while I did treatment. It really hasn't been worked on since.
To put it into perspective, AMCMS was written in PHP 4. I am now cured of cancer and ready to get back to work on my code.

AMCMS is cool, it takes a lot of the hard work out of making a web site, but it's so old now that it really needs to be gone over and rewritten. The old code can serve as a foundation to build exciting new features on. The core needs rewritten to PHP 7 standards but some of the old code was clever and can be copied over to the new system to save some time in developing it.

I run Windows 7 and I use XAMPP so I have a 'localhost' server to develop and test on. I also have a web site online where I deploy code to the production environment. I use a text editor called UltraEdit to write all the code in. It has features like syntax highlighting for web languages.
